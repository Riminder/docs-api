* **Tokenization :** Our method of tokenization gives our models additional advantages in terms of making them less prone or prone to typing errors by leveraging  information on _**subwords**_ and _**multigrams**._
* **Vectorization** : Our vectorization method consists of a hierarchy of levels, a first one at the word level by using our in-house pre-trained _**word embeddings**_ on the world largest HR entities dataset, then a second one for _**encoding paragraphs**_ \(sections in documents\) based on Natural Language Processing state of the art models.
