# Job API

Similarly to the Profile API, the Job API helps you connect HrFlow with the applications of your choice and allows you to POST jobs and GET outbound data after the processing of choice is done.

The Job API offers the same six processing bricks available for the Profile API : [Parsing](../ai-layers/parsing.md), [Embedding](../ai-layers/embedding.md), [Revealing](../ai-layers/revealing.md), [Searching](../ai-layers/searching.md), [Scoring](../ai-layers/scoring.md) and [Reasoning](../ai-layers/reasoning.md).
