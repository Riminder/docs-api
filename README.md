## API clients

Weâ€™ve developed API clients for the most common programming languages and platforms. These clients are advanced wrappers on top of our REST API itself and have been built in order to help you integrate our service within your apps. For example, you might choose to use our [PHP client](http://github.com/Riminder/python-riminder-api) for your indexing logic, while your front-end relies on our [Javascript client](http://github.com/Riminder/node-riminder-api). All our clients are [open-source and available on Github.](https://github.com/Riminder)
